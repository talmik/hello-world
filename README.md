# hello-world
My first repository

I am making some changes to this readme file so that I can explore making commits on branches. 

And I'm learning to type on this old clunker of a keyboard.... it's really awful. Why didn't they get nice mac keyboards with flat keys? The touch typing I learned to do doesn't work here. You have to push all the way down to make contact. Ugh.
